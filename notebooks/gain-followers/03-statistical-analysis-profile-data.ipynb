    "### The Question to be Answered\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we decide on which test to use, we need to be clear of what we want to solve. Is it:\n",
    "\n",
    "* To validate whether the population mean is correct\n",
    "* To compare the difference between 2 groups of data to see whether the difference is statistically significant\n",
    "* To validate whether there’s a relationship between 2 categorical variables\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Null and Alternative Hypothesis\n",
    "Next, you will be deciding on the hypothesis based on your test objective. A null hypothesis (H0) proposes that no significant difference exists in a set of given observations, and an alternative hypothesis (H1) proposes otherwise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For rejecting a null hypothesis, a test statistic is calculated. This test-statistic is then compared with a critical value. \n",
    "\n",
    "The critical values are the boundaries of the critical region.\n",
    "* If the test statistic > critical value, the null hypothesis is rejected.\n",
    "* If the test statistic ≤ critical value, the null hypothesis is accepted.\n",
    "\n",
    "P-Value\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than test statistic, P-value is another important result to look at. P-value is the level of marginal significance within a statistical hypothesis test, representing the probability of the occurrence of a given event. Therefore, a P-value that is less than 0.05, indicates strong evidence against the null hypothesis, so you reject the null hypothesis.\n",
    "The lower a P-value, the stronger the evidence.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As a conclusion, the larger the absolute value of the test statistic, the smaller the p-value, and the greater the evidence against the null hypothesis.\n",
